# ⚽ Real-Time Foul Detection in Football Matches Using Machine Learning Techniques  

A group thesis that focuses on improving the accuracy of foul detection in football matches using machine learning. The work evaluates various machine learning models, including **YOLOv5**, **YOLOv8**, **YOLO-NAS**, and **Faster R-CNN**, demonstrating their effectiveness with accuracies ranging from **89.85%** to **97.2%**, with **YOLOv8** achieving the highest performance. The models were deployed in a web application for real-time foul detection, with plans to further improve accuracy for fair play in live matches.
